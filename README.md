# Navigate to project folder
cd IAA_CHATBOT

# Install all required packages
npm install
```

**What this does:** Downloads all the tools your project needs (like installing apps on your phone)

### **Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the `/webhook` folder with:
```env
# Meta Cloud API Configuration
META_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_meta_access_token
META_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_number_id
META_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_business_account_id
META_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_webhook_verify_token
META_VERIFY_TOKEN=iaa_chatbot_verify_token_2024
META_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# Google Cloud credentials
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your/google-credentials.json

# Dialogflow project ID (NOT USED - Dialogflow is disabled)
# DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID=iaa-whatsapp-chatbot-oytl

# Server port
PORT=3000
```

### **Step 3: Convert Excel Data to JSON**
```bash
# Convert your Excel course data to JSON format
npm run convert-data
```

### **Step 4: Start the Server**
```bash
# Start the main chatbot server
npm start

# OR start the beginner-friendly version
node webhook/index_beginner_friendly.js
```

## 🔧 SETUP DETAILS

### **String-Based Response System (Current Implementation)**
1. **No AI Setup Required** - Uses simple string matching
2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - `"hi"`, `"hello"` - Welcome messages
   - `"show all courses"` - Show all course domains
   - `"domain X"` - Show courses in specific domain
   - Course name matching - Find specific courses
   - Fallback responses for unknown queries

3. **Response Logic**:
   - Direct string comparison
   - Partial matching for course names
   - Domain-based course organization
   - Automatic fallback to registration form

### **WhatsApp Integration (Meta Cloud API)**
1. **Create Meta Developer Account**
2. **Set up WhatsApp Business API**
3. **Configure webhook URL** to point to your server (`/meta-webhook`)
4. **Set up webhook verification** with your verify token
5. **Test with your WhatsApp Business number**

### **Local Development (Localtunnel/ngrok)**
```bash
# Install localtunnel globally
npm install -g localtunnel

# Create public URL for your local server
lt --port 3000

# Use the generated URL in Meta Cloud API webhook settings
# Example: https://abc123.loca.lt/meta-webhook
```

## 💡 FOR BEGINNERS

### **What is a Webhook?**
- Think of it as a **"phone number"** that external services can call
- When someone sends a WhatsApp message, Meta Cloud API "calls" our webhook
- We process the message and send back a response

### **What is String-Based Pattern Matching?**
- **Simple text matching system** that recognizes user input patterns
- It matches user messages against predefined patterns and keywords
- Example: "Tell me about SMS course" → System matches "SMS" to find Safety Management System

### **What is Meta Cloud API?**
- **Meta's official platform** for WhatsApp Business API
- Acts as a bridge between WhatsApp and our server
- Handles all the complex WhatsApp API stuff for us
- Provides secure webhook verification and message handling

## 🔍 TESTING YOUR CHATBOT

### **Test Commands to Try**
```
👋 "Hi" or "Hello" - Welcome message
📚 "Show all courses" - List all course domains
🏷️ "Domain 1" - Show aerodrome courses
🔢 "1" - Show first course in current domain
📖 "Safety Management System" - Get course details
💰 "What are the fees for SMS?" - Get pricing info
📅 "When does SMS start?" - Get course dates
```

### **Expected Responses**
- ✅ **Immediate responses** for basic commands
- 🤖 **AI-powered responses** for complex queries
- 📝 **Form link** for queries we can't answer
- ❌ **Helpful error messages** if something goes wrong

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING FOR BEGINNERS

### **🔍 How to Debug Problems (Step by Step)**

#### **Step 1: Check Your Server is Running**
```bash
# Look for this message in your terminal:
🚀 Server is running on port 3000
📱 Webhook URL: http://localhost:3000/webhook
```

**If you don't see this:**
- Make sure you're in the right folder
- Run `npm install` first
- Check for error messages in red

#### **Step 2: Check Your .env File**
```bash
# Make sure your .env file has all these values:
META_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
META_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_id_here
META_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_verify_token_here
```

**If values are missing:**
- Get them from your Meta Developer Dashboard
- Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` sign
- Don't put quotes around the values

#### **Step 3: Test Your Webhook**
```bash
# Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:3000/test

# You should see: "Webhook is working!"
```

**If you get an error:**
- Check your server is running
- Make sure port 3000 is not being used by another program

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **❌ "Module not found" Error**
**What it means:** Your computer can't find the required tools
**Solution:**
```bash
# Run this command in your project folder:
npm install
```
**Why this happens:** You haven't installed the required packages yet

#### **❌ "Credentials not found" Error**
**What it means:** Your .env file is missing or has wrong values
**Solution:**
1. Check your .env file exists
2. Make sure all required values are set
3. Get new credentials from Meta Developer Dashboard

#### **❌ "Webhook not reachable" Error**
**What it means:** WhatsApp can't reach your server
**Solution:**
1. Make sure your server is running
2. Use ngrok or localtunnel to create a public URL
3. Update your webhook URL in Meta Developer Dashboard

#### **❌ "No response on WhatsApp"**
**What it means:** Your bot isn't responding to messages
**Solution:**
1. Check server logs for error messages
2. Verify webhook URL is correct
3. Test with simple messages like "hi"

#### **❌ "Permission denied" Error**
**What it means:** Your computer doesn't have permission to run the code
**Solution:**
```bash
# On Mac/Linux, try:
sudo npm install

# On Windows, run Command Prompt as Administrator
```

#### **❌ "Port 3000 already in use" Error**
**What it means:** Another program is using port 3000
**Solution:**
1. Close other programs that might be using port 3000
2. Or change the port in your .env file:
```env
PORT=3001
```

### **🔧 Advanced Troubleshooting**

#### **Check Your Logs**
```bash
# Look for these messages in your terminal:
✅ Webhook signature verified
💬 Processing text message
📤 Sending response to user
```

#### **Test Individual Components**
```bash
# Test if your server is working:
curl http://localhost:3000/test

# Test if your webhook is working:
curl http://localhost:3000/webhook
```

#### **Verify Your Meta Configuration**
1. Go to Meta Developer Dashboard
2. Check your webhook URL is correct
3. Make sure you're subscribed to "messages" field
4. Verify your access token is valid

### **🆘 When to Ask for Help**

**Ask for help when:**
- You've tried all the solutions above
- You're getting error messages you don't understand
- Your bot isn't working after following all steps

**How to ask for help:**
1. **Copy the exact error message** you're seeing
2. **Tell us what you were trying to do** when the error happened
3. **Show us your .env file** (but remove the actual tokens!)
4. **Tell us what you've already tried**

**Example of a good help request:**
```
I'm getting this error: "Module not found: express"
I was trying to start the server with: npm start
I've already tried: npm install
My .env file has: META_ACCESS_TOKEN=*** (hidden for security)
```

### **💡 Pro Tips for Avoiding Problems**

1. **Always run `npm install` first** before starting the server
2. **Check your .env file** before testing
3. **Start with simple tests** before trying complex features
4. **Read error messages carefully** - they usually tell you what's wrong
5. **Keep your credentials secure** - never share them publicly

### **Debug Endpoints**
```bash
# Test if server is running
GET /ping

# Test if webhook is reachable
GET /test

# Debug webhook calls
POST /debug-webhook
```
